    <h1>2. Tobago</h1>
    <p>Trinidad’s beachier and wilder sister island, Tobago is a favorite among scuba divers. Nutrients from the Orinoco Delta make Tobago’s waters particularly enticing to the abundant marine life lured here and helps the island’s barrel sponges grow especially huge, too. Visitors can even get the ultimate underwater photo stretching their arms
         and legs out in a superman pose while practicing their neutral buoyancy above the world’s largest brain coral (16 feet in diameter), in the waters off Speyside, <strong>with Tobago Dive Experience.</strong></p>

    <p>Closer to the airport in the island’s south, base at <mark>Coco Reef Resort & Spa,</mark> Tobago’s grande dame oceanfront resort. The on-site dive shop,<strong>Undersea Tobago,</strong>  runs daily trips to dive nearshore reefs as well as the wreck of the Maverick, a former passenger ferry sunk in 100 feet of water that’s now home
         to free-swimming eels and octopuses.</p>

    <h1>3. Socorro and Revillagigedo Islands, Mexico</h1>
    <p>“If you dream of magical manta encounters and being surrounded by schools of hammerheads while being buzzed by an orca, then the Revillagigedo Islands are perfect for you,” says Julie Andersen, senior director of global brand and media for <strong>PADI.</strong> 
        For experienced divers, high-adrenaline diving awaits in these remote volcanic islands that can be reached only by liveaboards (where you sleep on a boat that’s your dive platform) that venture some 285 miles south off the tip of Cabo San Lucas on trips that range from 5 to 17 nights.</p>

        <p>November to May is the best season to dive at this spot. January into April is especially so, as this is when humpback whales are often seen migrating through the waters of the Revillagigedo Islands. Take part in citizen scientist expeditions 
            aboard the 16-passenger<strong>Quino el Guardian,</strong> , a former research vessel that’s among many dive liveaboards—including those from equally recommended <strong>Nautilus Adventures—cruising</strong>  this incredible place.</p>
